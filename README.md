# Microsoft Power Platform Parking Solution
As part of Microsoftâ€™s Power Up Challenge, I developed a parking management solution for Contoso High School using Power Platform. The project included a Dataverse data model, a model-driven app for submitting parking requests, a tablet-friendly canvas app for logging inspections, a Power Automate flow to confirm requests via email, and a Power BI report to analyze parking trends and identify unauthorized usage. This end-to-end solution highlights my skills in app development, automation, and data visualization with Power Platform.
